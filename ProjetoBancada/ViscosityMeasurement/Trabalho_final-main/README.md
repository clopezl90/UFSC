Automated Viscosity Extraction

This project implements a numerical code to automatically extract instantaneous viscosity readings from the digital display of a viscometer using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
It integrates these viscosity values with real-time temperature data acquired via LabVIEW to produce a combined dataset.
Finally, it generates a temperature–viscosity curve to analyze how temperature affects the fluid’s viscosity.
